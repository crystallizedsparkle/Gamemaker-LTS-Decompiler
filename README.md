# Why was this released?

This script was released in an early state because of it being showcased in a public repository of a [pre-release tester](https://github.com/burnedpopcorn), [modified](https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/UnderAnalyzer-Decompiler/blob/1bf409e932ffe8dae3c4affb861df859b7a5901e/UndertaleModTool/Decompiling_Scripts/---%20GMS2%20Decompiling%20---/Ultimate_GMS2_Decompiler_v2.csx) and [without my permission.](https://imgur.com/a/HlrwGE9)

This version has no stolen code from the leaked decompiler!

# Find an issue?

Please do report it using the github issue tracker!

I am not affiliated with UnderminersTeam and this script was made after a long week of fun
